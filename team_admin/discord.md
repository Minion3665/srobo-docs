# Discord Server

To assist with communications, especially in a virtual competition, there's a [Discord](https://discord.com/) communication both for communication with blue-shirts and among your team.

If you do not wish to, or are unable to join Discord, you can still get support from <{{ site.emails.teams }}> as normal.

## Joining

Invite links will be sent to team leaders which will ensure you're added to the correct team. Only team members should be given access.

Once invited, you'll only have access to a few channels, namely `#welcome-and-rules` and `#welcome-<username>` (with your username in). Before you can join, you must read the rules shown in the `#welcome-and-rules` channel, and enter the password for your team in your personal `#welcome-<username>` channel.

## Channels

The server has a number of channels for specific conversation. Please try to keep channels on-topic, and move channels if the conversation tangents. Each channel has a topic at the top of the screen showing what it's about.

### Team channels

Along with the common channels, there are some channels visible only to members of your team.

`team-ABC` (where `ABC` is your TLA) is a channel only your team (and blue-shirts) can see. Here you can converse among your team, and get help from blue-shirts without giving away too much of your strategy. These channels should be considered your own, and can be used to discuss anything competition related for your team.

If your school / institution has multiple teams (`ABC2` etc), there will be an additional channel for each of those (`teams-ABC2`). Remember to try and keep conversations specific to the team - just because the team comes from the same school / institution, doesn't make them any less your rival.
