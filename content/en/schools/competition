The SR 2011 competition game was announced at KickStart (18th September, 2010).
The [rules](/docs/rules/) have now been made available online.

In short, the 2011 competition game will involve a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.

*For the most up-to-date information on the competition game, please see the [rules](/docs/rules/).*
