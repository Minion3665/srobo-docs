The competition
===============

<img src="images/content/arena.png" alt="arena" class="right" />
The SR 2011 competition was announced at KickStart (18th September, 2010).
The [rules](docs/rules/) have now been made available online.

In short, the 2011 competition will involve a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
With it being a track, there is also scope for high-scoring robots that are fast. The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.

*For the most up-to-date information on the competition, please see the [rules](docs/rules/).*
