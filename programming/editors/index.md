# Code Editors

When developing code to run on our robotics kit, we recommend that you start by
using our hosted IDE. The hosted IDE provides an easy way to get going, as well
as ensuring that you have a history of your code which is available from
anywhere and your mentor can access. We appreciate that you may wish to use your
own editor instead, which you are free to do.

When developing code to run in the simulator, you will need to have both the
simulator and your own editor set up.

However you are working on your code, you are encouraged to ensure you have a backup!

## Choosing an Editor

There are lots of code editors to choose from. Several are freely available for
Python and support features which will make it easier to develop your code.

Some features to look for are:

- [Syntax highlighting][syntax-highlighting] makes it easier to see the overall
  structure of a program without needing to read every word.

- [Code completion][code-completion] offers suggestions of what you might want
  to type and can offer a way to explore what features an API offers.

- Interactive debugging allows stepping through code one statement at a time,
  examining the results as you go.

- Integration with tools known as "linters" which can help check that your code
  is well formed without running it (a process formally known as "static analysis").

While you can use a plain text editor like Notepad to edit your code, we would
recommend that you choose an editor which supports at least syntax highlighting.
