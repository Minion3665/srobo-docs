Programming Your Robot
======================

Robots that are made using the SR kit are programmed with [Python](/docs/programming/python/) which is made possible with a custom-built Python library, `sr.robot`; see [here](/docs/programming/sr/) for more details. The pages under this section should contain all of the information you need to know to successfully code for your robot.

* In order to develop the code for your robot, we recommend that you use a code
  editor. For more information about this, including some suggestions for
  suitable editors, see the [Code Editors](/docs/programming/editors/) section.

* Under the [Python](/docs/programming/python/) section, some of the more intricate features of Python are explained in sufficient detail to program a robot. Links to tutorials are also provided to introduce a new programmer to Python.

* Under the [sr](/docs/programming/sr/) section is an API reference for the Student Robotics module, used to interface with the hardware.
