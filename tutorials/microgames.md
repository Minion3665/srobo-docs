Microgames
==========

The microgames are way of getting familiar with your kit through a series of challenges.

Here is a link to the [Microgames](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IM6fUY_VvtmjGnyhDXHQEno5LzYBtLs_1xSdnyj9O1g/preview).

We recommend you work through them as a team, so you can learn from each other. If you have any issues, just ask us on [Discord](/docs/team_admin/discord).
