Brain Board
===========

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/content/kit/brain.png" alt="A photo of a brain board" title="A brain board" class="right" style="max-width: 50%"/>
The Brain Board provided with your kit is what runs the code you write and controls the other peripheral boards. It consists of a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and a Student Robotics KCH HAT.

The LEDs on the HAT display the current status of the robot and can be used to help debug your robot. There are also 3 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs that you can control from your code.

## Powering the Brain Board

Your Brain Board will not power on unless it's connected to the "L2" port on the Power Board. 
This is because the rest of the power outputs are disabled until the usercode runs. 

### Indicators

| LED              | Meaning
|------------------|-------------------------
| 5V Power         | The Brain Board is powered
| 12V Power        | The KCH is powered
| Reverse Polarity | The 12V power is reversed
| Boot Progress    | Progress Bar for Brain Boot Progress
| Code             | A USB containing code is plugged in
| Comp             | The Robot is in Competition Mode
| WiFi             | The Robot WiFi hotspot is running
| â™¥ (Heartbeat)    | Blinks when the Brain is running
| Start            | The Robot is waiting to start
| OK               | Shows the code status, see below table

### OK LED

The OK LED shows the status of your code using different colours.

| OK LED Colour | Meaning
|---------------|--------------------------
| Off           | No code available
| Cyan          | Your code is starting
| Yellow        | Your code is running
| Magenta       | Your code has been killed
| Green         | Your code has finished without errors
| Red           | Your code has crashed

## Flashing SD card

The SD card is located on the underside of the board underneath the green power connector. Grab the SD card with your fingers and simply pull it out of the slot.

To fully update your Brain Board's software, or refresh it if you think it's not working correctly, you can flash our SD card image onto the microSD card in your Brain Board.

To update the SD card, you'll need to download our image from the [updates page]({{ site.baseurl }}/kit/brain_board/updates). The latest version is `{{ latest_version }}`.
The flashing procedure is identical to flashing Raspberry Pi images.

### Etcher

We recommend using [etcher](https://etcher.io), as it's simple to use, and available on Windows, macOS and Linux. If you're familiar with Raspberry Pis or other similar boards and have flashed images before with a different tool, that will also work.

![Etcher example]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/content/kit/etcher.png)

<div class="info" markdown="1">
If you choose to use a tool other than Etcher, you may need to extract the `srobo-robot-{{ latest_version }}.img.xz` to `srobo-robot-{{ latest_version }}.img`. There are many tools available for this, e.g. [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).
</div>

### Flashing

1. Open Etcher and select the `srobo-robot-{{ latest_version }}.img.xz` file you downloaded
2. Select your SD card from the devices window
3. Click 'Flash!'
4. When the flash is complete you should safely eject the SD card.<br>
   Your computer may complain that the SD card is no longer readable, however
   this is expected as the data being written to the SD card is not in a format
   that either Windows or macOS can natively understand.
